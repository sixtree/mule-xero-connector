About this Cloud Connector
==========================
The Mule cloud connector for Xero supports the following operations of the Xero API.

![Xero API Support](/doc/APISupportTable.jpg)

For full details of the Xero API, refer to the Xero API reference - http://developer.xero.com/api/

There are four different types of operations supported by this cloud connector:

1. Retrieve a single Xero resource - Pass a unique resource identifier (such as an InvoiceNumber) as the input payload to any 'Get' operation supported by the Xero cloud connector (such as GetInvoice) to retrieve and XML-formatted string object representation of that resource.

2. Retrieve a list of Xero resources - Pass a blank payload request to any 'Get List' operation supported by the Xero cloud connector (such as GetInvoicesList) to retrieve a list of Xero resources. Filter parameters can also be applied to requests to refine the returned list - refer to the Xero API reference for further details of supported filter parameters.

3. Create Or Update Xero resource(s) - When passed an XML-formatted string object(s), this operation will either 
  - Create a new Xero resource if a resource matching the input doesn't exist, or 
  - Update a Xero resource if a resource matching the input already exists
    
  The operation will reply back with an XML-formatted string response message.

4. Create Xero resource(s) - When passed an XML-formatted string object(s), this operation will Create a new Xero resource (if a resource matching the input doesn't already exist).

All resources supported by this cloud connector conform to the Xero API XML Schema Definitions available here: https://github.com/XeroAPI/XeroAPI-Schemas

For an example of how to use this connector, refer to the sample project avaliable under the 'samples' folder of this repository.
